Face Smack (a.k.a FunForEveryBody) 
CSAW 2013 CTF Challenge

-----------------------------------------------------

The goal of the challenge is to obtain the key (in format: key{key here}) by clicking buttons 
in a specific order. The order can be reversed out of the binary - with enough dedication. On 
average, it's taken people between 4-10 hours to get it. <BR><BR>

If you start to play around with the challenge you'll notice each button click causes a change 
in the way a sentence is formed, you know when you got it right because the status message will 
read "The key Is key{some sentence}" instead of "The key is NOT key{some sentence}".
